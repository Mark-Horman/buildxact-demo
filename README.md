# Buildxact Demo

This project was generated with React version 17.0.1 and Gatsby version 3.0.3.

I have deliberately kept this as simple as humanly possible with the utmost minimal code I could utilise to solve the problem statement. I did however run out of time and have not implemented the table rows count on the menu items.

##Installation

Run `npm install`

## Development server

Run `gatsby develop` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `gatsby build` to build the project.
